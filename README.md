# Notes On Algorithms

Here is where I'll be sharing my notes on algorithms. As I learn, I'll continue to update and share in this repository. I leave verbose comments in my code because it's important for me to be able to understand how every piece of code works as I learn how to implement algorithms.

### File Structure
Each algorithm will have its own folder and a README file explaining how they work in my own words. I will also include completed exercises in Python.
