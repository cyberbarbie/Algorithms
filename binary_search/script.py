Exercise 1 - If you have a sorted list of 128 names and you're searching through it using binary search, what's the maximum number of steps it would take 

Answer is 7

log128 = log(2)128 == 2^7 or 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 128

Solution is 7 

"""

# in a list of 128 values, find index position of 5, else return null
print(binary_search(range(128), 5)) 


"""
if you double the size of the list, what's the maximum number of steps now?

log256 == log(2)256 == 2^8 == 256

It would take 8 steps
